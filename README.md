# Frequency ratio modeller
Landslide susceptibility analysis of raster grids using a frequency ratio model style approach (Chung, 2006).

The package contains two modules:
**analysis:** Conducts the frequency ratio analysis using continuous and thematic rasters and a landslide mask raster. Uses k-fold cross validation to evaluate the results.
**utils:** Utilities for handling the input and output of georeferenced raster grids. Based mainly on code snippets from the Python GDAL/OGR Cookbook 1.0 (https://pcjericks.github.io/py-gdalogr-cookbook/)
