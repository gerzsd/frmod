    "## The frequency ratio analysis in brief\n",
    "The frequency ratio analysis is a probabilistic method for landslide susceptibility assessment. It assumes, that landslide-affected areas in the future will have similar terrain and environmental conditions to the already landslide-affected areas. The inputs of the analysis are the landslide sample areas and the continuous or categorical data layers of the analyzed variables. The method works with raster grids.  \n",
    "The steps of the analysis:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Partition the study area into landslide and non-landslide subareas  \n",
    "2. Compute the frequency distribution of the analyzed variables for both areas \n",
    "3. Take the ratio of the landslide and non-landslide frequency distributions - *the frequency ratio* - for each analyzed variable\n",
    "4. Create the **frequency ratio grids**: assign the frequency ratios to the corresponding values of the analyzed variable grids\n",
    "5. Get the landslide **susceptibility grid**: average the **frequency ratio grids**\n",
